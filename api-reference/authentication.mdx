description: Learn how to authenticate API requests to the Shadeform API
---

The Shadeform API uses API key authentication for all requests. This guide covers how to create, manage, and use API keys.

## API Key Authentication

API keys provide a simple way to authenticate requests for programmatic access. They are ideal for server-to-server communication, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts.

### Getting an API Key

Generate an API key through the [Shadeform Platform](https://platform.shadeform.ai/settings/api). Once created, the API key will be displayed once - **store it securely** as it cannot be retrieved again.

<Note>
  Each workspace can have up to 10 API keys. You can create multiple API keys with different permissions for different use cases (e.g., one for production, one for development, one read-only for monitoring).
</Note>

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here"
```

### API Key Permissions

API keys can be created with specific permissions that control what actions they can perform:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `billing_read` | Read billing information, invoices, and payment methods |
| `billing_write` | Modify billing information, payment methods, and top-up settings |
| `platform_read` | Read instances, volumes, SSH keys, and other platform resources |
| `platform_write` | Create, update, and delete instances, volumes, and other platform resources |
| `admin` | Administrative access to platform management features |
| `owner` | Full account access (equivalent to account owner) |

### Important Notes

- **Key Storage**: All API keys are hashed with a pepper and stored securely. Once created, you cannot retrieve the original key value
- **Key Limits**: Each workspace can have a maximum of 10 API keys
- **Key Visibility**: API key values are never returned in GET requests for security. They are only shown once during creation or refresh
- **Security**: All API keys are fully hashed and secured in our database

## Error Responses

### Unauthorized (401)

The API returns `401 Unauthorized` when:

- No `X-API-KEY` header is provided
- Invalid or expired API key

Example response:

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### Forbidden (403)

The API returns `403 Forbidden` when:

- API key lacks required permissions
- Account mismatch (e.g., accessing another account's resources)

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Rotate API keys regularly** using the refresh endpoint
3. **Use environment variables** to store credentials
4. **Limit API key permissions** to the minimum required
5. **Monitor API key usage** and revoke unused keys

### API Key Management

- **Multiple Keys**: Create separate API keys for different environments or use cases (e.g., "Production CI/CD", "Development Script", "Read-only Monitoring")
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for API keys to easily identify their purpose
- **Permissions**: Grant only the minimum permissions needed for each use case. Use `platform_read` for read-only access, `platform_write` for instance management, etc.
- **Rotation**: Refresh API keys periodically for security. Use the refresh endpoint to rotate keys without losing access
- **Cleanup**: Delete unused or compromised API keys immediately. You can have up to 10 API keys per workspace
- **Key Storage**: Never store API keys in code or version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems


## Examples


### Using API Key for Instance Operations

```bash
API_KEY="your-api-key"

# List instances
curl -X GET https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY"

# Create an instance
curl -X POST https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances/create \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instance_type_id": "instance-type-uuid",
    "cloud_id": "cloud-uuid"
  }'
```

## API Key Management

API keys are managed through the [Shadeform Platform](https://platform.shadeform.ai/settings/api). You can:

- Create new API keys with specific permissions
- View all your API keys (names, permissions, creation dates)
- Refresh (rotate) existing API keys
- Delete unused API keys

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

**Solution**:

- Verify the API key is correct (no extra spaces or characters)
- Check if the API key has been deleted or rotated
- Ensure you're using the correct API key for your account
