description: Learn how to authenticate API requests to the Shadeform API
---

The Shadeform API uses API key authentication for all requests. This guide covers how to create, manage, and use API keys.

## API Key Authentication

API keys provide a simple way to authenticate requests for programmatic access. They are ideal for server-to-server communication, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts.

### Getting an API Key

Generate an API key through the [Shadeform Platform](https://platform.shadeform.ai/settings/api). Once created, the API key will be displayed once - **store it securely** as it cannot be retrieved again.

<Note>
  Each workspace can have up to 10 API keys. You can create multiple API keys for different use cases (e.g., one for production, one for development).
</Note>

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here"
```

### API Key Permissions

API keys are created with `admin` permissions, providing full access to all platform resources and management features.

### Important Notes

- **Key Storage**: All API keys are hashed with a pepper and stored securely. Once created, you cannot retrieve the original key value
- **Key Limits**: Each workspace can have a maximum of 10 API keys
- **Key Visibility**: API key values are never returned in GET requests for security. They are only shown once during creation or refresh
- **Security**: All API keys are fully hashed and secured in our database

## Error Responses

### Unauthorized (401)

The API returns `401 Unauthorized` when:

- No `X-API-KEY` header is provided
- Invalid or expired API key

Example response:

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### Forbidden (403)

The API returns `403 Forbidden` when:

- Account mismatch (e.g., accessing another account's resources)

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Rotate API keys regularly** using the refresh endpoint
3. **Use environment variables** to store credentials
4. **Monitor API key usage** and revoke unused keys

### API Key Management

- **Multiple Keys**: Create separate API keys for different environments or use cases (e.g., "Production CI/CD", "Development Script")
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for API keys to easily identify their purpose
- **Permissions**: All API keys have `admin` permissions, providing full access to platform resources
- **Rotation**: Refresh API keys periodically for security. Use the refresh endpoint to rotate keys without losing access
- **Cleanup**: Delete unused or compromised API keys immediately. You can have up to 10 API keys per workspace
- **Key Storage**: Never store API keys in code or version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems


## Examples


### Using API Key for Instance Operations

```bash
API_KEY="your-api-key"

# List instances
curl -X GET https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY"

# Create an instance
curl -X POST https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances/create \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cloud": "massedcompute",
    "region": "us-central-1",
    "shade_instance_type": "A6000_plus",
    "shade_cloud": true,
    "name": "my-instance"
  }'
```

## API Key Management

API keys are managed through the [Shadeform Platform](https://platform.shadeform.ai/settings/api). You can:

- Create new API keys
- View all your API keys (names, creation dates)
- Refresh (rotate) existing API keys
- Delete unused API keys

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

**Solution**:

- Verify the API key is correct (no extra spaces or characters)
- Check if the API key has been deleted or rotated
- Ensure you're using the correct API key for your account
